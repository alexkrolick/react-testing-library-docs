Hello friends! I'm pleased to announce the recent updates to the testing-library
family of tools! As always, we're committed to giving you the best tools to
enable you to have confidence in shipping your applications. That's why the
guiding principle for everything we do is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

This guiding principle has given us direction and we've been able to accomplish
a lot in the testing space. To further our mission, I'd like to make a few
announcements about changes going on in the testing-library world.

## [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) v4 released!

This is actually a pretty small release, but I think it's worth mentioning
anyway. We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. This release only has two
breaking changes. One is removal of deprecated methods you probably weren't
using anyway, and the other reveals potential bugs in your tests. So you should
be able to upgrade to this version with little-to-no effort.

If you do experience breakages, it's probably due to something like this:

  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

We hope that this helps you catch bugs better!

[react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
and
[cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)
have already been updated and released major version bumps of their own to
account for this upgrade. Other wrappers will hopefully follow shortly based on
their respective matinainers' schedules.

## [Testing Library on GitHub](https://github.com/testing-library)

We've created a new org on GitHub to manage the family of testing library
projects. The best part of the "Testing Library" isn't the code, but the
philosophy behind it. So we're using the organization as a way to group all the
projects that share the same philosophy and general utilities so whether you're
using Vue, Cypress, or React
([Native](https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library)), you'll
have a super testing tool that you're familiar with.

> I don't know whether you noticed, but
> [the React team officially recommends](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)
> you use react-testing-library to test your react applications. That's kinda
> neat :)

## [Testing Library on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library)

If the Testing Library family of tools has provided you any value at all, we'd
encourage you (or your employer) to contribute to our new
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library).

It is intended that funds raised by this open collective be used to:

- Donate to charities and other good causes
- Purchase testing-library related merchandise (stickers, T-Shirts, etc).
- Pay for hosting/domains/etc.

There are currently no plans to pay people who work on the project, but we
reserve the right to do so if it makes sense in the future.

## [Testing Library on Twitter](https://twitter.com/testinglib)

A lot of chatter is going on in the Testing Library world on Twitter, so we've
created a twitter account you can follow and keep up with what's going on.

> [Follow @TestingLib](https://twitter.com/testinglib)

## [Testing Library on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/react-testing-library)

We've had a pretty active spectrum community for react-testing-library. We're in
the process of moving that to a more general Testing Library spectrum so we can
have all discussion around the different wrappers in one place. There are over
600 members of our spectrum community (special shout-out to
[Giorgio](https://spectrum.chat/users/gpx) who has been SUPER helpful to people
there.) Please join us!
